The primary goal of Day 2 is to transition from the business-oriented planning of Day 1 to the technical preparations necessary for building a marketplace.

It is directly connected to the business goals defined on Day 1, ensuring that the technical solutions align with the marketplace's purpose and provide a solid foundation for its success.
